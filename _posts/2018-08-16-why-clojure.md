At my current company (Columinate at the time of writing) we write code in clojure and clojurescript. I have often been asked the question "Why clojure?". I hope to answer this question with this blog post and to highlight the pros and cons of opting for clojure.

Clojure is a pragmatic dynamic language that endeavours to be a general purpose language that is suitable in areas where Java is suitable.It is opinionated and does not try to cover all the paradigms but instead provides the features needed to solve real-world problems.It allows developers to avoid the costs of maintaining a different infrastructure while leveraging existing libraries.
