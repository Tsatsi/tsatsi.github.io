Today was the hardest to remain consistent with my daily posts or perhaps I should say yesterday as I'm a an hour late. but here's what I've learned about swift.

## Code Signing

This is performed  to ensure that your application is from the right source and has not been tempered with.

Xcode can automatically manage provision profiles, which is recommended by apple.

For more advanced usage such as creating signed builds through a continuous integration server, provision and certificates files can be downloaded from apple developer center.

## Steps to take

- Select a provisioning file/s that you intend to use to the sign app and ensure that the right type of profile is selected(development or production).
- Download the the provision file locally then upload it to appcenter.
- Select the certificate that is intended to be used  for code signing and ensure that the right certificate is selected(development or production).


## Conclusion

After a couple of days falling off the wagon, I managed to read this again. I think it was a bit rushed and will be getting back to it at a later stage.
