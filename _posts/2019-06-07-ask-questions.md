Society tends to reward people for coming up with answers but often sees people that come up with questions as a distraction or difficulty, but yet every good answer requires a good question. 
What if we approached things differently, what if we not only rewarded the kid with the correct answer in class but also the kid that raises their hand with a good question.

Now I'm not saying you should answer every question kids ask, but instead to encourage them to ask questions and to come up with answers. Good questions come from curiosity which is the root of every great discovery mankind has made.

By asking questions we are able to think deeper around the things we don't know. Good questions lead us to innovation when we come up with good answers.
