## Tsatsi Mahase 

I am an experienced software developer with a demonstrated history of working as a software consultant in banking, insurance and market research industry. I am skilled in Python, Clojure, Agile Methodologies, Javascript, and Mobile development. These are some of the technologies and methodologies I have experience in and will mostly be writting about on this blog, I do however need to emphasize that I identify myself as a problem solver and try as much as possible not to limit myself by the tools I use.

## Wise Mind

The name wise mind captures my aspiration, which is to develop a wise mind. I will be sharing on this space not only my work but interests as well, such as critical thinking, problems solving, mathematics, philosophy, design and many more.
